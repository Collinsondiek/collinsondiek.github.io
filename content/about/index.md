Hello! Interestingly I was first introduced to the field of cybersecurity during my undergraduate studies at [Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology, Bondo](https://www.jooust.ac.ke/), where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Security and Forensics (2018-2022) with a impressive grade point average.

Currently, I am a freelancer at Upwork working as a cybersecurity specialist, helping organizations to protect their computer networks and systems from cyber threats and attacks. My expertise include Penetration Testing, Vulnerability Management, Incident Response and Forensics, Compliance and Standards, Network and Web Application Penetration Testing, among others.

As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I am also constantly seeking new ways to stay informed about the latest trends and developments in the field. I blog about cybersecurity at https://threatday.wordpress.com, providing insights and information on various cyber security topics.

I am always interested in learning about new opportunities in the field, and I am eager to put my skills and knowledge to work for organizations that are committed to keeping their systems and data secure..

Here is a list of skills that I possess!
