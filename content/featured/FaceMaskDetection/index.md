I graduated from Cybershujaa training program at USIU and earned a [certification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-oojnK3kW4MPpBGLBiBCOIIERHiQTAjP/view?usp=sharing) as a cybersecurity professional 

This program provided me with the necessary skills and knowledge to tackle cyber threats in today's digital world. It was an intense but highly rewarding experience
