I am a cybersecurity professional with a background in ethical hacking and programming. [I am constantly learning new things in the field and particularly interested in the areas of penetration testing](https://www.tryhackme.com/p/lincolncollins)

I like to share my knowledge through writing cybersecurity blogs on [wordpress](https://threatday.wordpress.com) and helping out others, particularly those new to the field. I am always eager to assist and offer my help where ever I can.

In my free time, I like to unwind by indulging in my love for memes and memes-making [gags](https://sooneriwillhavemymemecollectionsite.com)!
